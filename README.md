# Quantified Self Scripts

Scripts for quantifying different stuff from my life.

Initially, I started looking into this for a [blog post](http://www.andisblog.de/2013/08/18/quantified-self/) (in German, sorry). But since then, the project evolved and now even measures different stuff **automatically**.

Examples:

  * Steps I walked (measured with my Fitbit)
  * Keys I pressed (measured with a tool)
  * â€¦
  
But also (not so automatized):

  * Coffee I drank (measured with a tally sheet)
  * Power my flat consumed (measured with a smart metering system we got as a beta test of our local power supply company)

The different automization as well as the evaluation scripts are in the subfolders of this direcotry. Check them out for individual README descriptions.

The website, displaying everything ready-to-look-at automatically is [quantified.andreasherten.de](http://quantified.andreasherten.de).
