# Quantified Self Scripts

Scripts for quantifying stuff from my life.

For a [blog post](http://www.andisblog.de/2013/08/18/quantified-self/) (German) I started looking into different quantities of my life.

Examples:

  * Steps I walked (measured with my Fitbit)
  * Coffee I drank (measured with a tally sheet)
  * Power my flat consumed (measured with a smart metering system we got as a beta test of our local power supply company)

For the second version I wanted to quantify some more different things. 
Here are the scripts I needed while processing and interpreting the data. They are probably incomplete, as I started using a recyclable set of scripts only during the evaluation process. But I might add new, completing ones for a possible next timeâ€¦ 

We'll see.
