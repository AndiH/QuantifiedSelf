# Quantified Self: Git Commits

This set of scripts create an entry in a database for every Git commit, keeping track of my coding productivity.


## Setup
#### 1. git-hooks
Benjamin Meyer's **`git-hooks`** are needed: [https://github.com/icefox/git-hooks](https://github.com/icefox/git-hooks)

Clone this repository locally and create a symlink for the executable in `/usr/local/bin` to put it to your $PATH:

    cd /usr/local
    git clone https://github.com/icefox/git-hooks
    ln -s /usr/local/git-hooks/git-hooks /usr/local/bin

Finally, create the user directory for git hooks:

    mkdir -p ~/.git_hooks/post-commit/

#### 2. GitPyhton module
These scripts collect information from the Git repositories with the help of the [GitPython module](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython). To install is, simply run

    easy_install gitpython

#### 3. Initialize commit scripts
Clone this repo to somewhere. Use `createLocalDb.py` to create an empty SQLite3 database in the current directory.

Fix the absolute path in `updateLocalDb.py` (line 11) to match your setup.

#### 4. Setup the Git hook
Symlink the `updateLocalDb.py` from this repository into the newly created directory.

    ln -s updateLocalDb.py ~/.git_hooks/post-commit/

Then, install git-hooks to run after each new commit. Run `git hooks --installglobal` to install the hook for all future repos. Run `git hooks --install` for your current working repo (and, subsequently, all other already existing repos). Alternatively, let the import script (next section) install git-hooks into found repositories. Finally, test it with `git hooks`.

#### 5. (optional) Import old commits and install Git Hooks
If you want all old commits to import into the database, run `importLocalCommits.py` -- be aware it might take a while. To specify the paths the it should search through, use the `--paths` argument like this:

    ./importLocalCommits.py --paths /path/to/repositories/ /another/path/

Depending on the directories you are scanning, this might take a while.

While scanning all repositories, you can also install git-hooks by adding `--install-hooks` as a parameter for `importLocalCommits.py`.


## Files
  * `createLocalDb.py` – Setups an SQLite3 database in which every commit is stored. More precisely, three columns are created: The hash value of the current commit, it's date and the commit message. Help output:

        usage: createLocalDb.py [-h] [--dropDB]

        Initializes the local database for Git commits.

        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
          --dropDB    drop the database if it already exists

  * `updateLocalDb.py` – Updates the database created by `createLocalDb.py`. It is called by Git's `post_commit` hook and puts the latest commit from the current working directory in the database. No arguments passable.

  * `importLocalCommits.py` — Searches for Git repositories in the user's home directory and extracts the commits made so far. Calls functions to extract data from `updateLocalDb.py`. Only commits from the local user are considered. Help output:

        usage: importLocalCommits.py [-h] [--install-hooks] [--max-repos N]
                                     [--no-recursive] [--paths PATHS [PATHS ...]]

        Search for existing Git repositories and import commits made by the local
        user.

        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          --install-hooks       install git-hooks in found directories
          --max-repos N         stop scanning after N repositories
          --no-recursive        don't scan recursively
          --paths PATHS [PATHS ...]
                                Paths to recursively scan for Git repositories. If not
                                specified, the user's home directory (~/) is scanned.


## Todo
  * Take care of the absolute directory in updateLocalDb.py. Config file?
  * Write a cronjob / launchctl script to transfer data to remote MySQL db from different computers used for coding

## Known Limits
  * This will only work locally
  * Pull requests, website edits, whatnots will not be covered in the database (they shouldn't, though, if I'm not the author…)
